# CleanCoding
This is for a programing exercise in clean code, and shows students that there are different ways to write the same code.
This repo a number of methods that each represent a clean code pricippel. The idea is that the students have to write thier method in the "clean" one and that is has to do the same thing as the "dirty" one.


A unit test project could be added to this solution.
